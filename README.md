# HR_ATTRTION
SQL + Excel project analyzing employee attrition patterns through data queries and interactive dashboards.

Employee Attrition Analysis
This project analyzes employee attrition using HR data to uncover patterns, key risk factors, and business insights. The goal is to help the company understand why employees leave, who is most at risk, and how to improve retention.

Key Insights
Overall Attrition Rate: 16.11%

Younger Employees (20s) experience the highest attrition.

Males are leaving the organization at a higher rate than females.

Overtime workers show significantly higher attrition than non-overtime workers.

Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition among job roles.

Employees with lower Job Satisfaction scores (1 or 2) are more likely to leave.

Employees with no Stock Options are more likely to leave than those with higher stock option levels.

üí° Business Recommendations
Support Early-Career Employees
Provide mentorship, clear career paths, and onboarding programs for employees in their 20s.

Improve Job Satisfaction
Conduct regular engagement surveys and build a culture that values employee feedback and recognition.

Address Overtime Culture
Monitor workloads and promote better work-life balance through policy and staffing support.

Introduce or Expand Stock Option Plans
Employees with stock incentives show stronger retention. Offer stock options to more roles.

Focus on At-Risk Job Roles
Investigate reasons for high attrition among Laboratory Technicians and other vulnerable roles.

Targeted Retention Strategies for Males
Since men are leaving more, explore career growth, flexibility, and financial recognition tailored to this group.
